"# Breast Cancer Detection Project" 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has breast cancer based on various features.

he dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. It includes 569 samples with 30 features each, describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target variable is a binary classification:
M (Malignant)
B (Benign)

The goal is to classify the tumors as either malignant or benign using machine learning algorithms.
